# ArchLinuxScripts
A repo to store my .sh scripts to install arch linux almost instantly

Each version is gonna have a different directory due to possible changes between them.

To use them, you have to use curl along with the raw link of the .sh file.

## Short links

No, I can't see your ip with these links, you can try yourself and make an account at https://cutt.ly/ then make a shortified link to prove it.
